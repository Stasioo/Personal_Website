            <h3>Discussion on AR objects</h3>
            <p>I definitely believe that augmented reality will become the next standard in our lives in the near future. After working on this project, it gave me a good idea of the difficulty it requires to implement augmented reality within anything. I think the main reason to why AR can become popular in the future is that it adds another layer of experience to one's day-to-day basis. That layer enables users to enhance their environments or situations that they are in, allowing the experience to become better or worse depending on the case. However, I see it as means of enriching one's experiences rather than worsening them. There are several examples that I can think of on the top of my head. Starting first with education, AR objects can help students learn different topics for the better. It can especially benefit those that do best in learning with visuals and interactivity. An example in the educational field with AR objects is that it can replace the usage of the whiteboard or enhance it by allowing AR objects to appear alongside the given material. Another example in the educational field is bringing AR objects within books. Stories can be enhanced with different variety of visuals that utilize AR. Looking at other places that can benefit AR objects, an example would be purchasing items. With special eyewear that is developed to show AR objects, one could possibly see an AR object of a price tag over items and be given the option of purchase the item. So if let's say I went to a grocery store whilst wearing my ar glasses, I can simply pick up an item like an orange and see AR objects that showcase attributes about it, such as price tag, nutrition, etc as well as the option of purchase it on the spot. This enhances the buying experience of items, bringing ease into knowing what we are buying, and making purchasing goods in one simple step. One other place that AR objects can benefit in their inclusion is in recreational places such as museums, amusement parks, music festivals, lives sports, etc. It can help it by adding AR objects that show direction and places of interest in the physical space such as arrows or giant marks in the sky that lead you. It can help the physical space by adding more decor to the environment enhancing the visual aspect of one's view, such as at a music festival where if one is wearing AR eyewear they can see additional visuals that complement the artist's performance. It can also help bring more information to the viewer, such as a live sports game, it can bring up an AR object that showcases a live updating scoreboard for the viewer to keep track of what's going on.
However, there is one possible drawback with bringing AR objects to everyone's view and that would be advertisements. Taking a look at the internet and television as examples, we can see how ads have evolved to be something integral in those experiences. Bringing ads into the augmented reality space can be quite bothersome to most users. Ads can take up a lot of space depending on how companies will approach them. It reminds me of a video by a designer named Keiichi Matsuda. The video was titled <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">Hyper-Reality</a>, and the video demonstrates the possible vision of how Ads look in an AR space. It shows how distracting, overwhelming, and annoying it can be with hundreds of ads competing with each other to get control of your view/attention. Such a possibility is one reason why AR can possibly not become popular in the future. </p>
